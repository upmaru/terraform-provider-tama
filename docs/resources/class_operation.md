# tama_class_operation (Resource)

Manages a Tama Neural Class Operation resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "tama_class_operation" "some-operation" {
  class_id  = tama_class.some-class.id
  chain_ids = [var.chain_id]
  node_type = "explicit"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `class_id` (String) ID of the class this operation belongs to
- `chain_ids` (List of String) List of chain IDs for this operation

### Optional

- `node_type` (String) Type of node (explicit or reactive). Defaults to 'explicit'

### Read-Only

- `current_state` (String) Current state of the operation
- `id` (String) Operation identifier
- `node_ids` (List of String) List of node IDs created by this operation

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import tama_class_operation.some-operation class_id:operation_id
```

## Notes

- Class operations are **immutable** resources - they support only Create and Read operations
- Update and Delete operations are not supported as operations cannot be modified or removed once created
- The resource will be removed from Terraform state when destroyed, but the actual operation persists in the system
- Operations automatically create nodes based on the specified chains and node type
